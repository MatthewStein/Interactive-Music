# Interactive-Music

This repo contains a smattering of small, single-file projects providing tools or frameworks for performance of computer-assisted or guided live acoustic music.

All of the code here was merely used to test out some new ideas. In many cases, I've taken ideas I particularly liked and expanded on them in larger (and more cleanly coded!) projects. I'll continue adding to this repo in a fairly unorganized manner, if you like some of these ideas, check back here occasionally!
